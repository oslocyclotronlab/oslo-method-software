>>>AN
AN Fit A and N separately

The level density parameter a (1/MeV) and the exponent n of Egamma are
used as fitting parameters to the 2-dimensional landscape of (Egamma,Ex)
obtained from the first generation gamma-spectra.
>>>>END
>>>AP
AP Add a new Peak to the fit set-up

If you have a peak fit set up, but wish to add a peak to this fit, use 
the command AP. You will be prompted for the position of the new peak. 
The width of the new peak will be set to its initial starting value, so 
if the widths are free, but relative widths fixed, you will be given the 
option of resetting all non-fixed widths to their initial values also. 
If the new peak is not higher in energy than the previous last peak, 
you may also select to re-order the peaks in order of increasing energy.
>>>>END
>>>AR
AR ARithmetic operations +, -, /, and * on matr./spc.

You can add matr./spec., multiply by factors etc. The operations
possible are listed below:
adding spectra               1=1+2    
adding constant              2=1+120.0
subtracting spectra          2=1-2
subtract constant            2=1-120.0
multiply spectra             2=1*2
multiply by constant         1=2*1.17
divide spectra               2=1/2
divide by constant           2=2/1.17
multiply spectrum*matrix     1=1x1
natural logarithm (x1000)    2=2log
derivate (x1000)             2=2der
NOTE: Integer numbers mean spectra, and real numbers mean constants
>>>>END
>>>CA
CA Get CAlibr. and dimension info. and eventually change these

The command tells what is the current energy calibration and
dimension of matr./spc. These values can be changed by you.
>>>>END
>>>CC
CC [N1,N2...] Change Color map to N1,N2...

The program uses a "color map" to display spectra in different colors
according to the value of the parameter I in the DS command. Thus, for 
example, DS 1 4  will display the spectrum in color 1,  DS 3 5  in 
color 3, etc. In order to overlay spectra in the same region but in 
different colors, use the CC command to change the color map. The old 
map will be listed, and the new map requested. You need provide only 
those values you wish to change; the other values will remain at their 
old values.
>>>>END
>>>CD
CD Cut away counts to the right of a defined Diagonal

The command allows you to remove counts in a matrix.
You define a diagonal by giving (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
The counts to the right of the diagonal will be zeroed.
>>>>END
>>>CE
CE  Channel/Energy toggling for display of axis

The CE command simply toggles between these two modes: If you have 
channels, you get keV (or MeV) on the axis. If you have energy,
you get channel display. This is activated by next display 
command. If the energy is higher than 2000 keV, the command
switches to MeV units. If no calibration exists, channel display
will be used.

>>>CF
CF Execute/create Command File

CF filename   take commands from disk command file
              CF CHK : check whether to proceed with command file
              CF END : end of command file
              CF CON : continue with present command file
              CF LOG : log all typed input to create a new command file
              (Use CF END to close new file)

Batch processing of sets of commands within Mama is achieved through the
use of the command CF to execute command files. The default extension for 
these files is .cmd. They may be written using the system editor utility, 
and can include any valid Mama commands. Be sure, however, to include 
valid responses to any prompts or questions the program may ask, since 
while the command file is being executed, it will replace the keyboard 
as the source of all user responses, with the exception of those 
involving the graphics cursor. If the program reads a command it does 
not recognize, you will be informed of this and asked if you wish to 
continue with the file execution.
>>>>PAGE
If you put  CF CHK  (Command File CHecK) as a command entry in your file,
execution will be interrupted at that point, and you will be given the 
option of continuing or stopping execution. This may be used, for example, 
to verify the quality of fits while the command file is being used to 
automate the fitting of a series of related spectra. If you elect to stop 
the execution of the file, you may resume at the same point in the same 
file at a later time by typing the command  CF CON (Command File 
CONtinue). In addition, the window may be cleared from within the 
command file by use of the command  CF ERA (Command File ERAse).

You may create command files directly in Mama, without using the system
editor, by typing  CF LOG. This will cause all typed commands and 
responses to be logged to a new command file, with a filename specified 
by you. You may enter the commands  CF CHK  and  CF ERA  into the file 
simply by typing them, and the commands  CF END,  CF filename  and  
CF LOG  will all close the new file. NOTE that these last commands will 
also be entered into the file, and executed when the file is called.
>>>>END
>>>CL
CL Calibration Lines for gammas

The command lists the energies (keV) and intensities for well known
gamma-sources
>>>>END
>>>CO
CO COmpress matr./spc. by integer value

This command contracts the current spectrum by the integer factor n.
Channels 0 through n-1 will be summed into channel 0, etc. The program
automatically calculates the new calibration for the matr./spec.

If you need to stretch/compress or turn over the direction of axis,
use the EL command (ELastic massage).
>>>>END
>>>CR
CR [N] Call CursoR and get info, or activate matr./spc.(X to exit)

This command causes the cursor to be called. By positioning the cursor and
typing any character other than X (e.g. a space, or the mouse button), the
co-ordinates of any point in the presently displayed axes may be 
determined. The counts in the channel is also given, and the energy 
is listed as well. 

If you point on the matr./spc. icon at the top of the window, you get
info on the matr./spc.: Energy calibration, dimension and number of 
counts. If you want to change these values, use CA (CAlibrate).

In order to leave the cursor mode of operation, click on the green button
in the upper right corner or type X. 

CR followed by an integer will cause a marker to be displayed in the
channel corresponding to that integer, and the counts and energy for that
channel to be listed. (See also the command IC).
>>>>END
>>>CT
CT Set CounTs per channel in singles spectrum using cursor

This command operates just on a singles spectrum. For matrices, use 
instead the PC (Put Content) command.

The CT command enables the user to alter the counts per channel over a
selected range of the display spectrum, by specifying the required 
contents. This may be done either through the cursor or by typing the 
desired value. If the spectrum is displayed, the cursor will be called 
up repeatedly. Each pair of entries through the cursor specifies a 
straight line between the cross-hair positions; the spectrum counts will 
be set to correspond to this line. To exit from the CT routine, simply 
type X. If, at either cursor entry, you type the character T (for Type), 
you will asked to type limiting channel numbers and the required counts 
per channel for that range.
>>>>END
>>>CU
CU Cut in matrix, e.g. xnew=x-1.0*y and ynew=y

The X and Y axis can be transformed to a new set of axis by defining
Xnew=Xold+F1*Yold and Ynew=Yold+F2*Xold. The calibration (keV/ch) is
conserved in the transformation.
>>>>END
>>>DE
DE Divide spc. by det. effic.(from an EFFIT .eff file)

Divides the display spectrum by a detector efficiency. The parameters
defining this efficiency should have been stored in an .eff file from 
program EFFIT. See also HElp EFFit.
>>>>END
>>>DF
>>>MP
MP Marker Position
DF Display Fit

These commands simply display the marker positions and fit, as currently
defined, on top of the most recent display of the spectrum. The
limits of the fit are shown as the vertical lines from the X axis to the
spectrum, and the vertical arrows with numbers below them are peak position
markers. The difference between the data and the fit (in counts per 
channel) is shown halfway between the spectrum and the X axis. The 
vertical offset is added to the difference to separate it from the X axis 
for reasons of visibility.
>>>>END
>>>DP
DP [N] Delete a Peak [peak no. N] from the fit set-up

Use this command to delete a peak from a fit you have set up, if you wish
to have fewer peaks. If you do not provide the number of the peak you want
deleted, the program will prompt you for it.
>>>>END
>>>DS
>>>OS
DS Display Spectrum, OS Overlay Spectrum

The commands DS and OS are used to display the current spectrum or matrix.
DS causes the window to be cleared before the spectrum is displayed.  
OS, which does not clear the screen, allows different spectra or portions 
of spectra to be displayed simultaneously. OS accepts the same integer 
arguments as DS, so that the spectra may be either overlapped or drawn 
on different parts of the window.

Using the command with the parameters DS [I,J[,K]] and OS [I,J[,K]] means
display Ith of J parts of the window. If the third parameter K is given
(or just the first parameter is given) then 1 gives full scale and 2 
gives autoscale.
>>>>PAGE
By default, the whole window will be used to display the part of the 
spectrum between channel limits previously defined using the DX, DY, 
DZ or EX, commands. However, by following the command with up to three 
integers, you may select a certain portion of the window for the display, 
and/or display the entire spectrum. In general, DS n m will select the 
nth of m parts of the screen for the display, while a trailing 1 
displays the full scale spectrum. Thus DS 1, for example, will display 
the entire spectrum on the whole of the screen. DS 1 4 will display the 
selected portion of the spectrum in the lowest fourth of the screen, 
while DS 2 3 1 will display the entire spectrum in the middle third.

The last display drawn is always considered to be the current display for
the purposes of the cursor, summing of counts, multiplication etc.
>>>>END
>>>DW
DW Display Windows as they are presently defined (not Oslo format)	

Displays the ranges and window labels of the currently defined window 
file (either SLice or Look-Up). For slice files, a background calculated 
from the stored peak-to-total ratio is also displayed. 
>>>>END
>>>DX
>>>DY
>>>DZ
DX  M1 M2    Low/high markers for Display of X axis
DY  M1 M2    Low/high markers for Display of Y axis    
DZ  M1 M2    Low/high markers for Display of Z axis 
	     
These commands are used to define the limits of display. 
Using the display commands DS, OS, DM, OM the matr./spc. is displayed 
with the markers defined by DX, DY and/or DZ. DZ -1, gives manual 
setting of 2-dim. levels. These limits will be deactivated (not 
active) if you apply e.g. DS 1 (full scale) or DS 2 (auto scale).
>>>>END
>>>EL
EL ELastic stretch/compress giving new a0,a1 and a2 calibration

This command work either on X or Y axis. You type the a0,a1 and a2 of
the old and new calibration. The program then changes the matr./spc. 
to give the wanted calibration. If e.g. the new a1 is not a multiple
of the old one, the counts in one channel before, will be distributed
on two or more channels afterwards. Thus, be aware of that a certain
smoothing (usually just over two channels) might take place. 

You can also use the EL command to change the direction of the e.g. X axis. 
Let us say the spectrum has 1000 channels. Type then 0,1,0 for the
old calibration and 1000,-1,0 for the new one.

If you simply want a compression of e.g. 3 and 3 channels, use instead the
CO (COmpress) command.
>>>>END 
>>>EX
EX     EXpand display using cursor (mouse)

The lower and upper limits of the X axis (channels) may be changed by
using the EX command. To change both limits, type EX. The cursor
will be called, and you must position it and reply with a character, 
once for each of the lower and upper limits. You may enter them in either 
order. You will be asked to provide either the new lower limit or new 
upper limit using the cursor. 

The EX command works also on matrices. The rectangular region to expand 
is defined by the hair-cross of the cursor. Click the mouse at lower left
corner and then click on higher right corner to define the region.
>>>>END
>>>FD
FD Fit Data points with polynomial, exponential, range, etc.

The FD command first ask the type of function you want to fit your
data points:   Polynomial  y=a+bx+cxx+dxxx ..(0)
               Hyperbolic  y=a/x ............(1)
               Exponential y=ae^(bx).........(2)
               Range R(E) from dE-E plot.....(3)
In the Chi**2 tests it is assumed that the data points are uncertain
within Ysigma=1, giving artificial Chi**2 values. Input values are 
given by clicking the mouse or typing from keyboard. Option (3) is 
made to extract range function for sorting events from particle 
dE-E telescope. You first have to sort out socalled bananas from the 
energy of the front detector dE (along y-axis) and the energy of the 
back detector E (along x-axis). The dispersion (keV/ch) of the 2 
detectors should be the same. The range function is described in the 
FUNCTION range(x,A), and might vary from time to time. Candidates are:
     range=x*(A(1)+A(2)*x)+A(3)*x/(x+A(4))     ,seems best
     range=A(1)*(x**A(2))                      ,in theory the best
     range=A(1)+A(2)*x+A(3)*x*x+A(4)*x*x*x     ,polynomial could work

>>>FG 	
FG Make First Generation matrix from exp. particle-gamma coincidences

This is a relative complicated procedure and you should read the paper in
Nucl. Instr. and Methods: M. Guttormsen et al. NIM A255(1987)518.

You need a set of unfolded gamma (NaI) spectra representing various
excitation energies. You also need to know the intensity (counts) N(Ex)
in the corresponding particle spectrum at these excitation energies. 
Alternatively, you may use the gamma-multiplicity M(Ex). To get an
idea of what is needed of inputs, just run the command (without writing
spectra to disk) and find what is needed.

FI Fix/unfix x-y display for PM command

If you make a lot of projections from matrices, it is often convinient
to conserve the old x and y axis. To disactivate the fix, type fi once
more.
>>>>END
>>>FN
FN Fill channels with Negative counts from neighbour chs.

The FN command looks first for channels with negative counts in the 
matr./spc. Then it searches the channels around if there are positive 
channels to take counts from and put into the negative channels. In 
this way the holes might be totally or partially filled up (=0).
The FN command conserves the total number of counts.

The region for search is given by a 1 (or 2) dimensional Gaussian 
described by FWHM in X (and Y) direction by the user. The channels
most close to the negative counts will then be used in the filling 
procedure.

If you need stronger effects, see the RN command (replace numbers).
>>>>END
>>>FO
>>>UN
FO FOld matr./spc. with NaI or Gaussian response matrix
UN UNfold matr./spc. with NaI or Gaussian response matrix

FO (and UN) (un)folds the gamma-ray spectrum with the NaI 
response function. It is also possible to use a Gaussian response
which is suitable for particle spectra. The command requires that
the response matrix has been created first by the command 
RM (Response Matrix). The response function must (of course) have 
the calibration of the matr./spc. which you wish to fold or unfold.
>>>>END
>>>FY
>>>UY
FY Fold matr./spc. with response matrix along Y-axis
UY Ufold matr./spc. with response matrix along Y-axis

FY (and UY) (un)folds the TAS summed gamma spectrum with a
response function. It is also possible to use a Gaussian response
which is suitable for particle spectra. The command requires that
the response matrix has been created first by the command
RY (Response matrix along Y-axis). The response function must have
the calibration of the matr./spc. which you want to fold or unfold.
>>>>END
>>>FX
>>>FR
FX [P]    Fix additional param. P or change fixed value(s)
FR [P,Q..]Free additional parameters P,Q..

These commands are used to fix or free (i.e. unfix) additional parameters,
or to change the values of parameters already fixed. If the command is not
followed by a parameter name or number, the parameters will be listed, with
asterisks indicating any fixed parameters, and you will be asked which
parameters you wish to fix or free. If you wish to fix or free just one
parameter, you may do so by typing the name or number of that parameter
following the command. For FX, you will also be asked for the fixed 
parameter value. <Rtn> to this question indicates that the parameter 
should remain at its current value.

In addition, you may fix or free the RELATIVE widths and/or peak positions
by giving RW (Relative Widths) or RP (Relative Positions) as the parameter 
name. You may fix as many parameters as you wish, provided that at least 
two independent parameters are left to vary in the fit. See also HELP RW 
or HELP RP - relative widths/positions.)

>>>FT
>>>NF
FT FiT spectrum
NF New Fit

FT [N] N=1-15: set-up for N peaks and do fit
       [N=0] : do fit using present parameter values
       N=-1  : recalculate initial param. estimates and do fit

Before typing these commands, you should first display the portion of
the spectrum which you wish to fit. The FT command has three slightly
different functions, depending on whether it is followed by an integer:
(a) >0,
(b) non-existent (or 0), or
(c) -1.
These are discussed below.
>>>>PAGE
When the command FT is followed by an integer between one and fifteen, 
this integer is taken to be the number of peaks required in the fit, 
and the program will proceed to set up for a new fit. You will be prompted
with "Limits for fit? (hit T to type)", and the cursor will appear on the
screen. You may then enter the boundaries of the spectrum region you wish 
to fit by positioning the cursor at the required channels and typing any 
character other than T (e.g. the mouse button or the space bar), once for 
each limit. The prompt "Peak positions? (hit T to type, R to restart)" 
will then appear, and you should respond by using the cursor to give an 
approximate position for each peak. If there are limit channels or peak 
positions that you would like to have given a special value, you may type 
the character T in response to the cursor when asked for that position; 
you will then be prompted to type the value. Limits should be given as 
integers, but peak positions may be real numbers. If you wish to restart 
the limit and/or peak position definition, type R at one of the peak 
positions; the program will then return to requesting the fit limits.
>>>>PAGE 
The NF command is equivalent to the FT n command except that you do not 
have to specify the number of peaks that you wish to fit. You just choose 
the fit limits and then indicate the peak locations until you have entered 
as many peaks as you wish (up to the maximum of 15). Then, type X or hit 
the third mouse button and the fit will proceed as described below.

The parameters of the fit will then be written on the screen, together with
the "parameter number" that identifies it. An asterisk in place of the
parameter number will denote any parameter that is already fixed at its 
initial estimate; that is, will not be varied in the chi-squared 
minimization. You will be prompted to type the name or number of any 
(additional) parameters that you wish to fix, one per line. Each time you 
fix a parameter, you will also be asked for the value you wish it to be 
fixed to. <Rtn> to this question indicates that the parameter should 
remain at its current value (in this case, at the initial estimate). 
Note that you may fix any parameter you wish, by giving either its 
number or its name (e.g. 7 or P1). In addition, you may fix the RELATIVE 
widths and/or peak positions by responding with RW ("Relative Widths") or 
RP ("Relative Positions"). In this way you may fix as many parameters as 
you wish, provided that at least two are left to vary in the fit.
>>>>PAGE
When you have finished fixing parameters, or if you do not wish to fix any,
type <rtn>. You will then be prompted for a maximum number of iterations 
to be performed. If the fitting algorithm has not converged before this 
number of iterations has been completed, the fit will be aborted. If you 
are unhappy with the way the parameters or markers have been set up 
(e.g. if you would like to fit more peaks, or free parameters etc.), 
answer 0 to this question, and no iterations will be performed. A <rtn> 
in response to the prompt will select the default of 50 as the maximum 
number of iterations.
>>>>PAGE
Once you have defined the maximum number of iterations, the fit will begin.
When the fit has been completed such information as the limits, number of 
peaks and iterations, and chi-square will be listed on the terminal. 
Provided that the fit converged, these data will also be written to the 
print file. You will then be asked if you wish to type and/or print the 
parameters; that is, have a listing of the parameter values sent to the 
screen and/or print file. This print file is labelled GF2.OUT, and may 
be saved, deleted, or printed and then deleted, on exiting the program.
   FT
If you type simply FT, without a following number, the program will return
to the point where it asks you for the maximum number of iterations, and 
then proceeds to do the fitting with the present parameter values as the 
new initial estimates. This command is used, for example, when the fit 

has previously failed to converge, or you have read in a new spectrum.
   FT -1
FT -1 has the same effect as the above (FT), except that before the fitting
is begun the non-fixed parameters will first be reset to their original 
initial estimates.

to change only one marker. Here N=1 and 2 for the lower and upper limits,
respectively, and N=n+2 for the position of peak number n. If there is no
integer on the command line, you will be asked if you wish to change the 
limits and/or peak positions, at which time you will be prompted with the

>>>DM
>>>OM
DM Display Multiple spectra (from matrix), OM Overlay Multiple spectra
DS Display Spectrum, OS Overlay Spectrum

The command helps you displaying a number of rows or columns
from a matrix as multiple singles spectra. DM 1 gives full scale.
We recommend the DM 2 alternative, which gives auto scale. If you
write DM only, the markers from last DX and DZ are used. Often
it is convenient with DX 0 200 and DZ 2. This gives x-axes from
channels 0 200, and auto-scaling for number of counts. Up to 
8x8 spectra can be shown simultaneously. If you wish to display singles
spectra of the whole matrix with more then 64 rows (columns), you should 
first compress (CO) the matrix one or more times.
OM is used to overlay (with another color) multiple spectra
(without erasing the old spectra). In forehand, you should
use DX and DZ (not DY), so that the markers are all the same
for proper comparison.

>>>PF 
PF Peak Find on spectrum or matrix

This command starts a peak find routine and list energies, fwhm, 
areas etc. of significant peaks on the screen. The results are also
automatically written (added) to your file peakfit.out file. This file
might grow big, if you use the routine on matrices with many peaks.
In cases you have displayed a singles spectrum, the peak position (keV)
and background is displayed for the peaks found.

The peakfind routine needs an estimate of the experimental fwhm given 
as a linear function of channels by fwhm=fw0+fw1*channel, and the
threshold for when peaks are listed according to the uncertainty
in counts: dA/A < threshold. The program makes automatically two
peak searches first, in order to give you good initial values for the peak
search.

The routine might fail on multiple peak structures and cases with low
statistics. You should then use the FT [N] command (or NF) instead.

   - A PAW spectr./matrix (a long array with numbers)
   - A table with coloumns and raws, the data must be numbers - no text
   - A singles spectrum obtained with ORTEC MCA from PC
The calibration and dimensions are read. These properties are glued

created which describes the detector response function for that energy.
Thus, the response matrix covers a triangle of a quadratic matrix
with dimension up to 2048x2048. The response matrix can be inspected by
the GR (Get Response matrix) command.

created which describes the detector response function for that energy.
Thus, the response matrix is tailored for total absorptin spectrometers
with dimension up to 2048x2048. The response matrix can be inspected by
the GY (Get response matrix along Y-axis) command.

>>>RP
>>>RW
RP N  Free (N=1) or fix (N=0) relative peak positions
RW N  Free (N=1) or fix (N=0) relative widths

RP [0] and RP 1 fix and free, respectively, the relative peak positions,
for those peaks whose position is not fixed. Similarly, RW [0] and RW 1 
fix and free, respectively, the relative peak widths, for those peaks 
whose width isnot fixed. The same effect may be achieved using the FX 
and FR commands, with RP or RW as a parameter name.

Fixing the relative positions and/or widths is very useful in analyzing a
series of spectra for which there may be slight gain shifts, so that the 
peaks may move slightly in absolute position but have a constant spacing. 
Fixing the relative widths from the start of a fit also has the effect 
of fitting one common width to all peaks in the fitted region. This is 
usually an excellent approximation, and has the additional advantage of 
decreasing the uncertainties on the peak areas, especially for weak peaks.

SP/C         Read in spectrum from matr. w/cursor for limits

This command is used to read a new spectrum from disk. The default 
extension for spectrum filenames is .spc, which corresponds to the GF2 
format. The CRL version can also read spectra from ORNL .SPK files, and 
from Chalk River style .mat and .spn files. For these latter formats, 
you need to specify the filename extension. If the last spectrum you 
read was from a .SPK, .mat or .spn file, and you wish to read a 
different spectrum from that same file, there is no need to retype the 
filename; simply give the number(s) corresponding to the desired 
spectrum or range of y-channels. In these cases, the program will read 
from the last file opened.
>>>>PAGE
SP/C (SPectrum using Cursor) will assume that you are reading from, or
intend to read from, a matrix (.mat) file. The cursor will be called, and 
you can use it to enter two gate limits from previously displayed spectra. 
If the last spectrum was not read from a matrix, you will then be prompted 
for the matrix file name.

The command SP-1 allows you to change the initial estimates of, or by 
default fix or free, the parameters R, Beta and Step. SP-1 will have 
this effect regardless of whether you previously used the file gfinit.dat 
or gfinit.cmd to initialize these parameters. You can also type SP-2 to

The commands SU may be used to sum over a range of channels, with

order. The subtracted background is taken as the straight line joining the
positions of the horizontal cross-hair at the two limiting channels. 
In each case, the area, centroid and width are computed. Negative
counts are neglected, since they strongly influence centroide and width.  

You may also sum over a selected range of channels by entering the command
SU <lim1> <lim2>, where <lim1> and <lim2> are the limiting channel numbers.
This form of the command does not require the current spectrum to be 
displayed on the screen.

it have to be an OD or SD spectrum - or deduced from these. For
example the projection of an OFFLINE matrix down in a singles
spectrum will be identified by the UD command, and you will
see a singles spectrum beeing updated. To stop the update
process, simply close the UPDATE window with the mouse.
Information transferred from MAMA to UPDATE is written in your

UC Subtraction of UnCorrelated events in gamma-gamma-matrix

The command makes a socalled uncorrelated background subtraction
of a gamma-gamma matrix of maximum dimension 2048*2048.
The background to be subtracted in channel (i,j) of the original
matrix is given by
       B(i,j)=(SumMat(i,jj)*SumMat(ii,j))/SumMat(ii,jj),
were double index indicates summation. We obtain a new corrected matrix
       MatCorr(i,j)=Mat(i,j)-0.9*Bij.

The command works on GF2 files (not Oslo format). The command
adds a window to the currently defined file (Look-up or Slice). The cursor
is called, and is used to specify the upper and lower limits of each 
window. For each window, in LU mode, the user is also asked for a look-up 
value to be inserted in the table for the appropriate range of channels. 
In SLice mode, the y position of the cursor is used to define a background 
for the gate, used to calculate the peak-to-total ratio.
>>>>END
>>>WM
WM [N] Change Weighting Mode (i.e. error bar)
       N=1/2/3: weight with fit/data/another spectrum

This command lets you select the algorithm to be used in determining the
weight to be applied to each channel in the fit. The integer n is by 
default one, so that the standard deviation assigned to the counts in a 
given channel is taken as the result of the fit, as calculated using the 
current parameter values for each iteration. This option removes excessive 
weighting of channels which have lower counts because of statistical 
fluctuations, and is generally to be preferred. If n is given as 2, the 
standard deviation is taken as the square root of the number of counts 
in the data itself. The third option, n = 3, is used in fitting a 
subtracted spectrum. Let us suppose, for example, that you are fitting 
a spectrum A, which is computed by subtracting a spectrum C, multiplied 
by a factor x, from spectrum B. That is, 
          counts(A) = counts(B) - x * counts(C)
then
          sigma**2(A) = sigma**2(B) + x**2 * sigma**2(C)
                      = counts(B)   + x**2 * counts(C)
>>>>PAGE
Thus the correct weighting spectrum may be obtained by computing a fourth
spectrum which is the sum of B and x**2 times C, and weighting according to
(the square root of) the counts in this fourth spectrum. After typing WM 3 
you will be asked for the filename of this weighting spectrum.

>>>>END
>>>PEAKFIT
Peak fit

Mama offers two ways to make peakfit. The automatic version (use the
command PF) is fast and even works on matrices, but is not so good as
the manual approach (use NF or FT [N]).

The manual least-squares peak fit program is designed primarily for use 
in analyzing gamma-ray spectra from Germanium detectors. However, it can 
also be used to analyze other types of spectra. The routine can fit portions of spectra with up to fifteen peaks on a quadratic background.
>>>>PAGE
The fitted parameters are :
   A,B and C :    Background = A + B*X + C*X*X
                  where X is the channel number minus an offset.
   R,BETA, STEP : These define the shape of the peaks.
                  The peak is the sum of a gaussian of height H*(1-R/100)
                  and a skew gaussian of height H*R/100, where BETA is
                  the decay constant of the skew gaussian (in channels).
                  STEP is the relative height (in % of the peak height)
                  of a smoothed step function which increases the
                  background below each peak.
   Pn,Wn AND Hn : The position (centroid of the non-skew gaussian),
                  width and height of the nth peak.
Initial estimates of A,B and C are taken to give a straight line
                  between the limits for the fit.
Initial estimates for Pn and Hn are taken from the given peak positions
                  (Hn = counts at peak position - background)
Initial estimate for R is taken as R = A + B*X (X = ch. no.)
Initial estimate for BETA is taken as BETA = C + D*X (X = ch. no.)
Initial estimate for STEP is taken as STEP = E
>>>>PAGE
FWHM = SQRT(F*F + G*G*x + H*H*x*x)  (x = ch. no. /1000)
Default values are:  F =   3.00, G =   2.00, H =   0.00

Mama fits a portion of the spectrum using the sum of up to fifteen peaks on
a quadratic background. Each peak is composed of three components:
    (1) a Gaussian,
    (2) a skewed Gaussian, and
    (3) a smoothed step function to increase the background on the 
        low-energy side of the peak. Components (2) and/or (3) can 
        easily be set to zero if not required.
Component (1), the Gaussian, is usually the main component of the peak, and
in Ge detectors, physically arises from complete charge collection of a
photoelectric event in the detector.
>>>>PAGE
Component (2), the skewed Gaussian, arises from incomplete charge
collection, often due to "trapping" of charge at dislocations in the 
crystal lattice caused by impurities or neutron damage. If the detector 
and electronics had infinite resolution, component (1) would be a delta-
function and component (2) would yield an exponential tail on the 
low-energy side. Convolution of this exponential tail with a Gaussian 

resolution function yields the functional form:
      y = constant
               * EXP( (x-c)/beta )
               * ERFC( (x-c)/(SQRT(2)*sigma) + sigma/(SQRT(2)*beta))
where ERFC is the complement of the error function, x is the channel 
number, c and sigma are the centroid and standard deviation of the 
Gaussian in component (1), and beta is the decay constant of the 
exponential. Beta now corresponds to the "skewedness" of the skewed 
Gaussian.
>>>>PAGE
Component (3) arises mainly from Compton scattering of photons INTO the
detector and from escape of photoelectrons from the Ge crystal, which 
result in a slightly higher background on the low-energy side of the 
peak. The functional form used in mama is:
             y = constant * ERFC( (x-c)/(SQRT(2)*sigma) )
which is produced by the convolution of a step function with a Gaussian of
width sigma.

When both R and Beta are allowed to vary during a fit, component (2) will
usually greatly increase the uncertainties calculated for the peak areas. 
This is because there is a large cross-correlation, between the heights of
components (1) and (2), which is not properly taken into account in the
calculation of the uncertainties. Since, if Beta is unknown, the relative
height of the skewed Gaussian is not generally well-determined by the fit, 
the large uncertainty in the relative heights yields a large uncertainty 
in the area. If, however, at least one of the parameters R and Beta can 
be fixed at some reasonable or previously determined value, then the 
quoted error on the area is usually reliable.
>>>>PAGE
For this reason, and for the purpose of consistency, it is suggested that
at the start of the analysis of a series of spectra, at least one 
preliminary pass be made in the analysis of a source calibration 
spectrum, to determine a set of shape parameters R, Beta and Step 
which describe the peak shapes well, as a function of channel number. 
Experience shows that Beta and Step do not seem to vary appreciably with 
gamma-ray energy, and R can usually be approximated by a straight line 
(or combination of two straight lines, one at low energies and the other 
at higher energies) as a function of channel number. These values can 
then be entered as the initial estimates, and one or more of the 
parameters fixed, on entering the program. Initial estimates may also 
be entered from within the program by typing the command SP-1.
>>>>PAGE
The limits of the fit are shown as vertical lines from the X axis to the
spectrum, and the vertical arrows with numbers below them are peak position
markers. The difference between the data and the fit (in counts per 
channel) is shown halfway between the spectrum and the X axis. The 
vertical offset is added to the difference to separate it from the X axis 
for reasons of visibility.

About Mama (ver. 4.0, Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory, 1995-1996)

Mama is a program for Manilulation of Matrices and spectra. You control
2 big matrices of dimensions 4096*2048 and 2 spectra of dimension 8192.
You can make various operations on the matr./spec. and the best way to 
learn how the program works, is to use it. A list of available commands
can be obtained by typing HE SUM.

When you start a Mama session, you should be located in the directory
where your spectra are, because then you do not have to type the whole
PATH name at read/write operations. Use the "cd" UNIX command to walk
to the proper directory. Type then Mama, and you are up running. To 
end your Mama session simply type ST (STop).

>>>>PAGE
Mama is designed to be user-friendly, in that it is as self-prompting and
self-documenting as possible. Commands are entered as a two-character 
command word, possibly followed by an optional filename, a number, or 
a series of up to three numbers. Any additional information required 
to execute the command is requested by the program. The space 
following the two-character command, separating it from any parameters, 
is optional. Also, delimiters between integer parameters may generally 
be either spaces or commas.
>>>>PAGE
It is usually possible to exit gracefully from a multiparameter command 
by answering with wrong data types. After e.g. the question "Destination 
spectrum:" you type "a" instead of "1" or "2". Then you return to the 
main program without executing the command.

The program contains modules from the programs GF2 (ver. 6.4)
written by D.C. Radford and R.W. Macleod  and KELVIN (ver. 1.0) written 
by M. Guttormsen. The source code is mainly written in FORTRAN 77. The
display and window routines are written in C with calls to XLIB functions.
This version of Mama is implemented on the SPARCstation 10/512 (lynx) 
at the Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory. It can be accessed either from the 
console or from X-terminals (or emulated X-terminals on Mac or PC).
A Department of Physics report on Mama 3.0 is available. If you have
problems with the program, please contact:

Latest news about commands

Jan.2 1995
The x-dimension for the matrices is now 4096, and spectra in 
shared memory can be displayed by the new commands OD and SD. 
The new command IC, simplifies the selection of matr./spc. 
Please, use HE (help) to learn more about these commands.

Febr. 2. 1995
Display of matrices is several times accellerated in cases where 
number of channels is lower than number of pixels.

March 7. 1995
The PF peakfit routine is completely rewritten and works much better
now, including background subtraction. The command can also be applied
on matrices.

March 8. 1995
The UC command makes a socalled uncorrelated background subtraction
of a gamma-gamma matrix of maximum dimension 2048*2048. For details,
type: he uc

March 8. 1995
Mama/spectrum window is no longer "hanging" by start.

March 24. 1995
New green button, and a few-pixel adjustment of y-axis.

April 7. 1995
The command HE gives menu listed according to topic.
The command DZ gives slightly other levels for 2-dimensional
representation of matrices.

April 20. 1995
A new command FD (Fit Data) allows you to fit various functions to
data points. The inputs are given by clicking the mouse, or by keyboard.

June 16. 1995
New intelligent display-marker mechanism in function Setmarker.f.
Now, hopefully, the program resets display-markers to dimensions 
when reading in new spectra, and keep markers when projecting 
matrices several times, and so on... Give me feedback, if it 
doesn't work!!

August 1. 1995
World wide release of MAMA 4.0: 
1. Old and not used commands deleted:
   SA,SF,RD,FF,EF,DU,IN,GD together with the respective routines:
   opengf2.f, edit.f, pfind.f, dump.f, contract.f, encal.f, storfit.f 
   and storac.f.
2. Spectrum icon displayes the marker limits if they are narrower than
   the dimension of spectrum.
3. No longer the GF2 COMMON block with SPEC(8192).
4. Names for the 4 icons (and display spectra) treated separately.
5. The comment of the header will now contain the history
   of the file. For example, this comment "|SD:ALFNA CO 3 3SM:" means 
   that the file was first time created by Sirius and called ALFNA, 
   then compressed 3 times in x and y direction, and then finally
   smoothed. The symbol "|" separates commands for each time Mama was started.
6. The SU command also gives standard deviation of distribution.
7. Often filename and time written in the upper right corner
   of the display window overwrites important parts of the spectra.
   This text information can be omitted by the TX command. To
   reactivate the text, type TX once more.
8. NEWs is now topic, so you must type HE NEW to learn about new commands.

August 15. 1995
1. The parameter ICAL listed just before the calibration constants
   in the headerfile of spectra, now means number of calibration
   constants. It is usually 3 for singles and 6 for matrix spectra.
2. The option (type=2) to read a sequence of spectra allows now to
   read as an example: NA-0, NA-6 and NA-44. The result is then a 
   matrix with y from 0-44, having a dimension of 45. The empty rows
   in between are zeroed. 

September 4. 1995
1. New and better interpolation between experimental responsefunctions
   in order to get a reliable responsematrix.
2. A new unfolding procedure, which works much better for continuum
   NaI spectra. (You might still select the old version, but it gives
   unfolded spectra with a lot higher fluctuations than the new routine.)

October 17. 1995
   The new command UD (UpDate) displayes in a new window SIRIUS or
   OFFLINE spectra every 5-10 seconds.

Dezember 20. 1995
   The CL command lists calibration lines from gamma-sources.

January 10. 1996
   Version MAMA 4.01 released with new and better response functions 
   and unfolding technique. Also other minor changes have been 
   implemented.

February 2. 1996
   Version MAMA 4.1 released. Faster ds 2 for matrices. Subroutine cleanup.f
   indicates if markers on icons are outside dimensions. Subroutine
   setmarker.f is slightly changed for matrices, taking XDIM and YDIM into
   account for auto mode.

February 19. 1996
   By overlay MAMA suggests new color for spectrum. DX 1 and DX 2
   means now that full scale (1) or autoscale (2) is performed
   only on x-axis. This feature also applies for the y- and z-axis.
   Auto-scaling for matrices accelerated 4 times.
   
March 7. 1996
   Cosmetics:
   Changed ticks on axis to go from axis and into spectrum-area. Removed
   free pixels at right side of spectra. 

June 3. 1996
   The 511 annihilation peak is now correctly centred around 511.0 keV
   in the unfolding procedure. (Previous, the shift could in worst case
   be a1/2.). Thus, if a peak (511, single esc., double. esc or full-energy),
   falls in between two channels x1 and x2, a corresponding height of
   y1 and y2 are distributed on the channels. In extreme, a peak might
   then have a FWHM of Wch=2 channels before smoothing is performed. Thus, we
   do not smooth with the total FWHM Wtot, but instead SQRT(Wtot**2-Wch**2).

September 12. 1996
   Release of MAMA 4.2 with about 10 small adjustments. Most important:
   Display markers for the 2 matrices and 2 spectra are stored and are
   applied next time the CR or IC commands are used. The CT command makes
   it easy to draw or change spectra.

October 1. 1996
   New pallet of colors for 3D-plot. Can be changed by the change color (CC)
   command.

December 24. 1996
   Release of MAMA 4.3:
   (1)Spectra is now written and read in free format (not as 8I8).
   Highest integer is limited to 2 147 483 646. Spectra take now much
   less space on disk (sometimes 1/10). In addition, reading and writing
   is faster. If some problems with the new format arise, use the old
   mama-version called mama4.2. (The new subroutine is called rewr.f,
   earlier readwrite.f).
   (2) A new command WP allows to write spectra as a sequence of number,
   so that PAW can read this as a vector.
   (3) A new stand-alone program, mama2paw, transfers the new mama-spectra
   to PAW, if needed. 
   (4) The weighting function in Figega (FG) is slightly modified, only
   positive weights are allowed. Furthermore, the areacorrection accepts
   only 0.85 < alpha < 1.15. The program suggests Ex/Eg-multiplicities.
   (5) In arithmetic command (AR), the last option allows matrix*vector
   multiplication.

June 1. 1997
   Release of MAMA 4.4:
   SC 3 remains until e.g. SC 1 is given.
   Corrected OL: no calibrations allowed on y-axis (COMMON/OL/ changed).
   Corrected OL: After dx 100 200, you may type dz 2 giving auto y-axis
   for the command OL in region between x = 100 - 200.
   Sets environment (SE) command implemented. Important for the access of
   64 contra 8 telescopes using SD and OD commands.

October 1. 1997
   The autoscaling in y-direction was earlier overestimated when
   number of pixels < number of channels. This is corrected in setmarker.f
   and outlay.f subroutines. The program is also made more robust against
   crashing, if you try to write files (peakfit.out, resp.dat, ...) to 
   a directory where you have no write access. The project matrix (PM)
   command gives more intelligent defaults values: by EX command the
   low and high markers are used as default integration limits. PM also
   remember last dimension (x or y) and the corresponding limits.

December 10. 1997
    The fit (FD) to bananas now contains 4 optional fit-functions. The 
    first and fourth functions are the best ones, I think...

March 20. 1998
    New command FI will fix the x and y channel display for projections (PM).

April 10. 1998
   Implemented natural logarithm and derivation of spectra and matrices (AR).
   The smooth command (SM) is modified so that the Gauss-tail is followed
   all the way out to 1% of full amplitude (at center). The smoothing
   matrix can be as large as 100 x 100 channels (previous 50 x 50). Also
   slightly new treatment at the boarder of matrix, where part of the
   smoothing matrix is outside the boarder. These modifications also 
   influence the FN command. The changes are only important in special
   cases. The elapsed time of the FN and SM commands might be 4x longer
   compared to revious algorithms.

May 20. 1998
    Release of MAMA 5.0:
    The MAMA is finnaly going REAL. Outputs and inputs may have format like
    0.754572E-47. You are permitted to write dz (or dy) -0.000332 2.195
    Real MAMA can read old MAMA spectra. You may still start the INTEGER 
    version by typing mamai. The integer MAMA can read new real MAMA
    spectra, however, numbers will be truncated.

November 21. 1998
    Implemented command RA, which randomize spectrum. Modifies 
    number of counts with random +/- stat. errors. Corrected RN and
    FN statistics. No more ABORT if writing to directory without
    write-permission.

January 19. 1999
    MAMA 5.1 released:
    The DS 2 command for matrices made more appropriate.
    The FN command also treat filling of -0.321 correct.
    The FN gives new and more clever estimates made for FWHMs.
    The FN allows to delete very negative numbers before filling.
    The RN (replace numbers) have now 4 options, to see type: he rn
    The RM did not reset a vector. This caused crazy unfolding
    if RM was repeted after each other - now corrected.

February 12. 1999
    The FD (fit data) command includes now also Fermi gas level density.
    The various fit-functions can now be written to file. It is also
    possible to write out the first trial function.
    Corrections for DS command, so that singles spectra with very big
    (or small numbers) may be displayed. Limits are 1.0E+38 and 1.0E-38.

March 11. 1999
    The following new commands operate now:
    DS and OS - Display and Overlay Spectrum or matrix
    DM and OM - Display and Overlay Multiple spectra
    This convension makes that:
    Use DM instead of OL
    Use OS instead of OV
    Use MP instead of DM

May 12. 2002
    The read command RE also reads coloums of data (called table)
    Take care that you have no ASCII text, only numbers
    The no of coloumns gives Y-dim
    and the number of raws gives X-dim
    You may later rearrange the matrix with the XY command

November 11. 2002
    Calibration is maintained if the new spectrum has a0=0 and a1=1.

November 7. 2019
    New for version 7.5.3: Improved coding for the folding and
    unfolding of the Ex-axis for SuN, mainly more iterations
    and setting reasonable energy limits. The commands end with “y”:
    ry - make response matrix for y-axis (summed Ex from gammas)
    uy - unfold the y-axis
    fy - fold the y-axis
    gy - get the response matrix for y-axis

    Folding and unfolding routines have input files called input.unx
    and input.uny for x-axis (gamma rays) and for y-axis (summed Ex for SuN).
    The first-generation procedure also has an input file
    input.fge (previously called figegain.dat). These three input
    files contain the input parameters for the last run and makes
    it easier to re-run the program.

    Output files are called respxout.dat and respyout.dat.
    The unfolding procedure has now 200 iterations as default (max 500).
    For Ex-unfolding, matrices that have a shift in energy
    (channel 0 has not energy 0 keV), is proper treated
    independently on the shift (a0 parameter).

    (The resp.dat file is now dedicated to hold parameters
    for the response functions.) Some more comments concerning
    folding/unfolding and cosmetics are included.
