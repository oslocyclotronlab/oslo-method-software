The spy program displayes at certain time intervals
the number of counts in matrices like NASP, ESP and
so on. One may choose one spectrum as basis, so that
the counts of other spectra are calculated relative
to this normalization. The EDESP matrix may be
appropriate as monitor.

The spectra to be monitored and the range-of-interest
is given by starting the spy program.

The program modules of this program, is very similar
to the update and mama programs.
