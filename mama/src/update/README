The update program displayes (at certain time intervals) the spectrum 
just displayed by MAMA - before the UD command is given. 
The spectrum can be directly an SD or OD spectrum - or a spectrum 
deduced from these by projection along the x or y axis. 
It can also be an OUTLAY of a matrix with up to 64 spectra with 
auto-limits on x and y (that is actually z) axis.

Before the loop with updating starts, we have to know:
Is it a SD or OD spectrum: iD = 1 or 2
Is it a projected spectrum along x or y axis: ixy = 1 or 2
The channels projected: i1 - i2 
Is it singles (DSPSP), matrix (DSPMA) or outlay (OUTLAY) of rows (coloumns)
It is either rows (iRC=1) or coloumns (iRC=2) shown in OUTLAY
The channels shown as singles in OUTLAY: m1 - m2

All this information is written to the file updateinfo.dat by MAMA, 
and the first part of the program main.f interprets this text file. 
The update process can either be started by typing 'update' in an 
xterm window - or in MAMA by the UD command. If no updateinfo.dat 
file excists from MAMA the default NASP is shown with dimension 
32x2048 from shared memory of SIRIUS.
