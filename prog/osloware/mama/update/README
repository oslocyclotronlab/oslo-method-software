The update program displayes (at certain time intervals) the spectrum just 
displayed by MAMA - before the UD command is given. The spectrum can be 
directly an SD or OD spectrum - or a spectrum deduced from these by projection 
along the x or y axis. It can also be an OUTLAY of a matrix with up to 64 
spectra with auto-limits on x and y (that is actually z) axis.

Before the loop with updating starts, we have to know:
Is it a SD or OD spectrum: iD = 1 or 2
Is it a projected spectrum along x or y axis: ixy = 1 or 2
The channels projected: i1 - i2 
Is it singles (DSPSP), matrix (DSPMA) or outlay (OUTLAY) of rows (coloumns)
It is either rows (iRC=1) or coloumns (iRC=2) shown in OUTLAY
The channels shown as singles in OUTLAY: m1 - m2

All this information is written to the file updateinfo.dat by MAMA, and the 
first part of the program main.f interprets this text file. The update process 
can either be started by typing 'mamaupdate' in an xterm window - or in MAMA by
the UD command. If no updateinfo.dat file excists from MAMA the default NASP is
shown with dimension 32x2048 from shared memory of SIRIUS.
